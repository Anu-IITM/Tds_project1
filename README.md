**GitHub API Scraper - Delhi Users (100+ Followers)**

1) The **scraping process** uses GitHub's REST API to find Delhi-based users with over 100 followers, Python for scripting, JSON parsing to extract data, and rate limit handling to comply with GitHub’s API policies.
   
2) **Interesting Finding** is that many developers in Delhi have private repositories or few followers, despite valuable contributions, highlighting that follower count or visible repositories don’t always reflect a developer's expertise or impact, as some choose to work privately or contribute in less visible ways.
   
3) **Actionable Recommendation** is that developers can enhance visibility and grow their network by contributing to open-source projects to showcase skills, collaborate with others, gain recognition,  build valuable connections, all while improving development expertise and boosting presence on platforms like GitHub.
