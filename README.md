**GitHub Users Scraper - Delhi (100+ Followers)**

This project scrapes GitHub users from Delhi with more than 100 followers and retrieves details about their public repositories.

- **Process to Scrape the data**: **GitHub REST API**: Primary source of data to search for users in Delhi who have more than 100 followers, fetching relevant user metadata. **Python**: Scripted the scraping process. **JSON Parsing**: Extract relevant details from API responses. **Rate Limit Handling**: To comply with GitHub’s API usage policy.

- **Interesting Finding**: During the scraping process, one intriguing observation emerged, A significant number of developers in Delhi either have their repositories set to private or lack a large follower count, despite making valuable contributions. This highlights the fact that follower count or visible repositories may not always reflect a developer’s impact or expertise. Many talented developers choose to keep their work private or contribute in ways that don’t necessarily translate into high visibility on GitHub. This underscores the diversity in how developers engage with the platform and the community.

- **Actionable Recommendation**: For developers looking to enhance their visibility and expand their network within the developer community, we recommend: Contributing more to open-source projects. By participating in open-source, developers can showcase their skills, collaborate with a wider audience, and gain recognition for their contributions. Open-source involvement not only boosts visibility on platforms like GitHub but also helps in building valuable connections, learning from peers, and improving overall development expertise.
