TDS Project 1 on Github API Scraping
- This script scrapes GitHub users from Delhi with more than 100 followers and fetches details about their public repositories.
- One interesting finding: a significant number of developers in Delhi have their repositories set to private or don't have many followers despite their contributions.
- Actionable recommendation: Developers should contribute more to open-source projects to increase visibility and network in the developer community.
